Projects in this repository are which I coded to practice vanilla javascript with the help of the video - "https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4?si=s7ma6XVGywC78e6Y" as guide and lesson.

I recommend, when opening these projects in browser, to make sure internet connection is available so that
css links for fonts, and links for icons can work properly.
